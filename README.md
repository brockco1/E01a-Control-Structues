In this assignment I answered a list of questions posed in questions.txt that had to do with this color guessing game. Through this assignment I was able to learn how each separte line of code that made up this game worked. I learned a lot about the different funtions of the game and I was able to try making comments on lines of code.I was also able to open up my persecptive on game design becuase for a simple guessing game I wasnt thinking how I could improve on the game so when I saw the ability to count the number of tryes it takes someone to beat the game I was surprized.
